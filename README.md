# Credit-Card-Fraud-Transactions
## Business Understanding
Credit Card Fraud has become a significant issue for bamks and credit card issuer companies. It is important to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Therefore, a good credit card fraud detection system is requried for identifying the fraudsters and thereby mininmising the losses for financial institutions.

## Business Objective
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The business objective is to predict the credit card fraud using the data from the transactions.

## Goals of Data Analysis
In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of the transactions, build predictive models to identify credit card frauds. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not provided. Instead the PCA components are provided.
